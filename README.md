# Plasettaja
- This is a project made for making the sitz parcipants' placing easier for the event coordinators
- This came to me as an idea last year when I was organizing sitzs for Digit and decided it takes way too much time to manual place people around
- Basically what program does is takes the csv file and takes into consideration peoples' avecs, allergies, menu options etc. and then makes an excel file that shows colored cells based on those which can then be printed for the staff so that they know what to serve for each one.
- Currently WIP
